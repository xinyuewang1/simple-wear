The idea behind simple-wear is to provide hassle-free daily wearing guide. 

It is the most scientific clothing ensemble recommender system exist in the market (research done at Oct, 2019).

The target user group is:
 - who prioritise comfort other than fashion style
 - who wants to minimal the items in closet
 - daily commuter 
 
By using simple-wear, only **33 different items** would be needed for a whole year round to keep your body temperature thermal equilibrium to the vicious outside world. The clothes recommended have clear layout which is really for no-brainers.
Since the pieces are based on casual business dressing code, this should suits most work labours.

## Feature plan
They are open in issues. I'll try my best to implement all of them. Meanwhile, if anyone interested in help, very appreciated.
